# Level 25


## Level Goal
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user
bandit26 is not `/bin/bash`, but something else. Find out what it is, how it
works and how to break out of it.

## Access
```
ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
pwd: uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG

## Set Aliases
```
alias l='ls -lah --color=auto'
alias v=vim
export EDITOR=vim
```

## Current Level Password File
```
/etc/bandit_pass/bandit25
```

This level is a bit confusing to solve. Let's try to navigate things around first.

I do not understand why we have a pin and a password for `bandit24`.

## TRY to use the private ssh key - FAIL
```
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

ssh: connect to host bandit.labs.overthewire.org port 2220: Connection timed out
```
It timeouts...Can I use a different shell to connect with ssh? 
Let's check it with `man ssh`.  I can't seem to find something that is useful.

## TRY to execute a command when connecting - FAIL
```
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 echo $SHELL

ssh: connect to host bandit.labs.overthewire.org port 2220: Connection timed out
```
It timeouts, and the command fails. How can I find out what shell the `bandit26` use?

## TRY to find clues by scanning ports
```
nc -zv localhost 1-9999

localhost [127.0.0.1] 6012 (?) open
localhost [127.0.0.1] 6011 (?) open
localhost [127.0.0.1] 6010 (?) open
localhost [127.0.0.1] 113 (auth) open
localhost [127.0.0.1] 22 (ssh) open
```
What's the `auth` here at port 113

### TRY Connect to open ports
```
nc -v localhost 113

localhost [127.0.0.1] 113 (auth) open

0 , 0 : ERROR : UNKNOWN-ERROR


nc -v localhost 6012
nc -v localhost 6011
nc -v localhost 6010

```
60xx ports just timeouts.

## TRY to connect via ssh verbosely
```
ssh -vi bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

OpenSSH_7.4p1 Debian-10+deb9u7, OpenSSL 1.0.2u  20 Dec 2019
debug1: Connecting to bandit.labs.overthewire.org [176.9.9.172] port 2220.

debug1: connect to address 176.9.9.172 port 2220: Connection timed out
ssh: connect to host bandit.labs.overthewire.org port 2220: Connection timed out
```
It also timeouts. I'm not sure on how can I approach this now.

## TRY to connect with localhost - PASS
```
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost

  Enjoy your stay!

```

I forgot that when connecting to the same host, I do not need to provide the
hostname and the port.

## Look for bandit26 passwd file
```
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26

bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```
It's using `/usr/bin/showtext`

## Analyze the `showtext` file
```
cat /usr/bin/showtext

#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```
First time seeing the `TERM` environment variable. Let's look for an answer: [this][term1] and [this][term2]..
It executes `more` to `~/text.txt` file then exits. Can I just change the `more` binary,
by changing `PATH` environment variable?

## Check file permission
```
ls -lah /home/bandit26/text.txt

-rw-r----- 1 bandit26 bandit26 258 May  7  2020 /home/bandit26/text.txt
```
I do not have the right permission to view the file for the current user.
But it just seems that it's just the ASCII art shown when logging in...

## TRY to mess up `more` command - FAIL
```
# create empty directory
$ cd $(mktemp -d)
/tmp/tmp.9E8ImbEyBF

# use vim instead
$ which vim
/usr/bin/vim

$ ln -s /usr/bin/vim more
$ ls

more

# check PATH
$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games

# update PATH
$ export PATH=/tmp/tmp.9E8ImbEyBF:$PATH

# check if more is vim
$ more --version

# try to see if the `PATH` would be inherited for the same host
$ cd ~
$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
```
- I wasn't able to override the command, turns out that when logging in the `$PATH`
  is not inherited. It uses its own environment variables, and realizing that it
  is logical to use its own environment variables and not inherit them ğŸ¤¦.

- Is the `TERM=linux` the hint? I can't seem to find a hint for that.
- Is there more for `more` command? Let's scan the man page.

## Scanning `more` man page
```
man more
```
I can't find anything that will help me, as I can't pass any **OPTIONS** directly.
Why do they need to set `TERM=linux`?
