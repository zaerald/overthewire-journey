# Level 12

## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt`, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under `/tmp` in which you can work using `mkdir`. For example: `mkdir /tmp/myname123`. Then copy the datafile using `cp`, and rename it using `mv` (read the manpages!)
