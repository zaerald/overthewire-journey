# Level 13

## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by user `bandit14`. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: `localhost` is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

## Access
```
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
