# Level 20

## Level Goal
There is a `setuid` binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes
a connection to `localhost` on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It
then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in
the previous level (`bandit20`). If the password is correct, it will transmit the
password for the next level (`bandit21`).

**NOTE:** Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think
