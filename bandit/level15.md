# Level 15

## Level Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port `30001` on `localhost` using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…
