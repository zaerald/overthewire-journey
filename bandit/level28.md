There's an interesting commit for the latest one. Let's see the diff.

## View commit diff
There are multiple ways to do this, but it's just the recent one so I'll just
check the relative to the `HEAD`.
```
git diff HEAD^

We can also do `git show <commit-sha>`
They just removed the password from the `README.md` file.
